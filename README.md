This repository is new and will act as a reference for programming in GGSIPU university.

# Note: 
Computer graphics programs need Turbo C++ compiler to run. They can also be made to run in Code::Blocks using additional libraries or in Linux with the help of SDL's implementation of Borland Graphics Interface(SDL_BGI).
